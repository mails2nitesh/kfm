PLEASE NOTE: I haven't worked on KFM in more than 3 years now. This project is not actively updated. Please consider using a different one. If you are a developer, please feel free to take whatever code you want from this project and re-use it however you want.

KFM is an ajax file manager, which is usable as a plugin for RTEs such as FCKeditor, or can be used standalone.
> It is currently available in Bulgarian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Irish, Italian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, and Spanish.
> With KFM, you can manipulate your files and directories via the Internet.
> Some rudimentary image manipulation is provided. For example, you can resize/rotate images, and you can attach captions to the images, which will automatically be provided to whatever program you are using to access KFM.
> A basic search engine has been implemented (you can search for parts of filenames), and a tagging engine has also been implemented.
> KFM also uses the CodePress project for syntax-highlighted text editing.

The code is quite easy to edit. If you are a coder and interested in it, please have a read of the source - you may find it to be easy to work with. If you do make any changes, please mail me about them - I will either accept your work thankfully, add you as a subversion user (if you're very good, or very productive), or at the least, I'll give you a few comments on your work and suggestions on how to get your work accepted into the codebase.
